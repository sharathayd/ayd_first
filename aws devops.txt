	vpc --- virtual private cloud 

network --> inter net ..  interconnection of network 
network is a group or system of interconnected system 

everyone is connected to internet 
that id --> IP address 

IP address --> IPv4,IPv6

IPv4 --> 32 bit address --> four octets    X.X.X.X
                                                                            x-> 00000000 - 11111111 , 0-255


 	ipv4 --> 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255

	public IP and private IP 
	
	ipv4 ---- 192.168.1.6 -- private ip 
                     ipv4 --115.98.91.239 -- public ip 

ipv4 divided into 5 classes
1) 1.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 --> class A 
2) 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 --> class B 
3) 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 -> class c 
4) 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 --> class d 
5) 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 --> class e


private IPs in a class A --> 10.0.0.0 -- 10.255.255.255 -- > 65535
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 --> 16384
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 --> most used one 

CIDR --> class less inter domain routing 


net and subnet 
network --> 8000 IP 
subnet -- > small network within a the network 


network bits and host bits

in a network , network bits doesnt change .. host bits will change 
0.0.0.0 --> 
192.168.0.0/32   this 32 specifies no of network bits --> no host bits so single IP is avilable 
192.168.0.0000000(n/w)      0 (host)/31 --> 2 IPS 
192.168.0.000000(n/w)    00(host)/30 --> 4 IPS 

2 power (32-mask bits) --> no of hosts 

192.168.0.0/28 --> 16 ips
10.0.1.0/24 --> 256 IPs
10.0.0.0/18 --> 16384 IPs 


VPC --> main network 
different depts --> diff subnet 
based on work and visibility to the others 
again these subnets are classified into 2 types 
1. public subnet --> which the dev wants people to access --> those servers 
we keep in 
2. private subnet --> some of servers which we dont want to have access to the people


web servers, application servers -- > websites --> public subnet 
DB server --> private subnet 

VPC --> we create public and private subnets 

as many no of public and private subnets we can create 

in public subnet how many servers i can keep ? as many 

here in network setup , we provide an IGW for internet to the public subnet 
by default there will be no internet to the private subnet 

NAT --> internet to private subnet 



15/11/2023
1. we created a VPC 10.0.0.0/16
2. have created 2 subnets --> 1. public subnet 10.0.1.0/24
                                                         2. private subnet 10.0.2.0/24
3. created igw --> detached --> attach it to VPC
4. RT --> default RT --> modified it as public RT --> subnet assoc --> added public subnet
    routes--> add route --> 0.0.0.0/0 --> target as igw 
5. created NAT --> give the name of nat--> allocate a elastic IP to it --> create 
6. create a new RT --> subnet assoc --> attach private subnet 
     routes --> add route--> 0.0.0.0/0 --> NAT 



16/11/2023

ECC --> EC2 -->ELASTIC CLOUD COMPUTE 
SERVER --> COMPUTER 


OUR COMPUTERS --> CLIENTS 
CONFIG --> I5 , 8 GB , 512 GB SSD , 2GB GPU , WINDOWS OS 
--> IT CAN SERVE ONE PERSON AT A TIME

SERVER --> CAN SERVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE 
CONFIG --> XEON , 100 GB , .... WINDOWS SERVER OS 



17/11/2023 

windows server creation , we logged in using RDP 
linux server we use SSH to login 

SSH --> secure shell 

SSH --> Putty , mobaXterm 



if it is a linux machine .. and if we are using putty to access it 
we need to convert the pem file key to ppk file 
putty gen software is used to convert 
in puttygen .. click on load --> select the pem file 
pop up msg comes as it is successful --> save the private key 
u will get this ppk file 


login to putty --> give ur public ip der --> 
go to ssh --> auth --> credentials --> private key --> browse for ppk file 
click on okay --> 
give username as ubuntu .. check the basic commands 


mobaxterm --> click on session --> click on ssh 

give remote host address --> if needed username 
go to advanced setting browse for ur pem file  
click on okay
linux interface will appear 


20/11/23

CREATE A VPC --> I LL CREATE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SUBNETS 
WE NEED TO KEEP TWO SERVERS .. ONE IN PUBLIC SUBNET 
OTHER IN PRIVATE SUBNET 
WE NEED TO VERIFY THE CONNECTIVITY 


21/11/23

VERIFY THE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IN BOTH 
IN PUBLIC SUBNET AND ALSO IN PRIVATE SUBNET 
CREATE A VPC 
HAVE 2 SUBNETS .. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
KEEP A SERVERS IN BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
CHECK INTERNET CONNECTIVITY FRO PUBLIC SERVER 
AS WELL AS FROM PRIVATE SERVER 


24/11/23

WEB SERVER: 

WEBSITES ARE HOSTED 
SERVER --> IIS , TOMCAT , APACHE2 

CLIENT<------------------->INTERNET<-------------->SERVER 
http request / http response 
SSL TERMINATION 

MAIL SERVER:
SENDER , RECEIVER MECHANISM
SENDER ---> MAIL SERVER ----->INTERNET ---> MAIL SERVER --->RECEIVER 
SMTP --> SIMPLE MAIL TRASFER PROTOCOL 
IMAP / POP ---> AT RECEIVER END 
IMAP --> INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESING PROTOCOL 
POP --> POSTOFFICE PROTOCOL 



DNS SERVER :
OUR SERVER HAVING A PUBLIC IP 
BY USING IP WE ARE ACCESSING IT
EVERY SERVER WILL HAVE PUBLIC IP
DNS --> DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM 

IF U TYPE EXAMPLE.COM --> DNS SERVER --> REPLIES WITH --> PUBLIC IP OF EXAMPLE.COM
NOW BROWSER ---> SENDS ---> HTTP REQUESTS TO THAT PUBLIC IP 



PROXY SERVER:
U R CONNCTED WITH CONNCTED TO INTERNET THROUGH THIS SERVER 


FTP SERVER 
FTP --> FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL


ORIGIN SERVER:
CDN --> CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK 
PIC --> IN US SERVER --> FROM US --> ASIAN SERVER 
INDIAN SERVER --> U CAN ACCESS 
IT GETS STORED IN LOCAL SERVERS 
IT WILL HAVE WEB VISITORS AND RESPONDS TO THEM 

APPLICATION SERVER:

API           EX:REST 
CRUD --> CREATE , READ, UPDATE , DELETE 


DATABASE SERVERS:


we launched web server 
from windows machine and also from linux 
3.119.123.234 --> website 1
11.12.12.23

DNS --> domain name system 

3.119.123.234  ---> facebook.com 

chrome (browser) --> DOmain name --> DNS Server -->DNS server responds with the ip of the domain 

DNS service in aws --> route 53

53 it is port number of DNS 
80 --> http
22--> ssh 

domain name 



hosted zone --> collections of records 

A record --- > combines u r ip with domain name 

CAA record --> SSL terminations 

AAAA record --> ipv6 
CNAME record -->  used for third party dns 


back up :
2 types of backup 
1. volume level backup ---> snapshot 
2. system level backup ---> AMI 


snapshot
we can add a volume while creating it self 
or else 
seperately we can create a volume and attach it to a running ec2


AMI ----> amazon machine image 
to create system level backups 

AMI S  are of 4 types 
1. quick start ami or amazon ami
2. my AMI s 
3. AWS market place AMI s
4. COmmunity AMI s 


SECURITY IN AWS
------------------------------------

DEVSECOPS , MLOPS ETC ETC 


DEVOPS 

1. NETWORK ACL S -- NACL-- network access control list
2. SG - SECURITY GROUP

NACL IS A SUBNET LEVEL PERMISSIONS 
WE CONFIGURE BASED ON PORT NUMBERS ... NETWORKS 
RDP  -- OPEN FOR ALL 
HTTP --
SSH-22
FTP 21 
TELNET -80
DNS-53


SG -- > SERVER LEVEL PERMISSION 

STORAGE 
AWS ---> 3 TYPES --> 
1. EBS VOLUMES --- elastic block storage 
2. EFS --- elastic file sharing 
3. S3 --- sss ---- simple storage service 


EBS                                                                EFS                                                             S3 
1. NEEDS A COMPUTER                1. DOESNOT NEED ANY 	1. DOESNT NEED ANY COMPUTER
				COMPUTER	
2. 1 DISK -- 16TB		2. 5TB			2. INFINITE DATA --- BUCKET-5TB 
3. FILE SYSTEM IS DER	3. FILE SYSTEM IS DER	3. NO FILE SYSTEM 
4. BLOC 			4. BLOC			4.BLOB 
5. IOPS 			5. IOPS 			5. 
6. one server		6. avilable for whole vpc 	6. avialable across globe 

S3:
SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE 
3 THINGS : 1, BUCKETS 2 FOLDERS 3 OBJECTS(FILES)

S3 --> CREATE A BUCKET --- OBJECT OF 5 TB 
100 BUCKETS IN A ACCOUNT 



AWS LAMBDA FUNCTION
-------------------------------------------------
-> A LAMBDA FUNCTION IS A SERVERLESS ARCHITECTURE 
WITHOUT SERVER WE CAN EXECUTE OUR TASKS 

-> FIRST STEP OF U GUYS .. TOWARDS AUTOMATION ..
HOW TO TRIGGER A LAMBDA FUNCTION .. 1. SCHEDULE BASED   2.EVENT DRIVEN 

AUTO SCALING ---> IF TRAFFIC IS HIGH AUTOMATICALLY NO OF SERVERS WILL INCREASE 
IF THE TRAFFIC IS LOW NO OF SERVERS GETS REDUCED 


Repositories --- Repos 
SCM tool -- source code management tool 
VCS ---> version control system 
ex of vcs : git , TFS (Team Foundation Server --- microsoft)

git , github 

git 						github 
software installed on our computer 		online cloud repository 
2005 it started 					2008	
command line control			administrated through web 
open source 				open source
